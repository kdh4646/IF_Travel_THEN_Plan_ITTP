# 🚀 Introduction

- When people plan for travel, they need to use multiple applications such as calendar
to add schedule, map to find the way to the destination and so on. Instead of turning
on multiple applications, combining useful functions into one application to help
travelers more comfortable. Application’s name is “ITTP (IF: Travel THEN: Plan)”.

# 🚀 Introduction

- When people plan for travel, they need to use multiple applications such as calendar
to add schedule, map to find the way to the destination and so on. Instead of turning
on multiple applications, combining useful functions into one application to help
travelers more comfortable. Application’s name is “ITTP (IF: Travel THEN: Plan)”.

# Project details



d

  Using Android Studio, with unique features that we did not use in the class such as
  “GPS” and “Calendar”.
  
  I. Application Icon
    - Background color with green or blue.
II. First Screen
- Make button: user makes a new travel plan.
- Start button: user starts a travel plan that he/she choose.
- Edit button: user can edit his/her travel plans.
- Open button: user opens travel plans that he/she made before.
- Setting button: user can either change the background color of
application.
III. Click Make button
- Calendar appears: user needs to choose specific date that he/she want to
travel. (from/to)
i. Choose date
- Categories: giving user the categories that they want to choose.
For example, eating, shopping, sightseeing, etc.
- Put Where: This information will be used to track the
destination on the map.
- Make a note: after choosing categories, user can put notes
below for specific location and so on.
- Based on how many days user wants to travel, app provides
each screen to put plans.
- Example)
For example, if a user choose date
from 10/16/2019 to 10/18/2019
then, 2screens need to appear that “First day plan” and user can
choose categories “eating” with location “GMU Panera” and
make a note “09:30 am. Salad would be nice”.
User can put more plans.
If done with first day plan, then go to the second day plan and
do the same thing.
ii. Done with plan setting
- Ask user that he/she wants to get notification or not.
- If yes then, choose specific time.
User will get notification later at specific time.
- If no then, back to the First Screen with the message that
new travel has been made.
IV. Click Start button

start.
If user chooses past travel plan, then the chosen
travel plan starts with today’s date and added to
the travel list with new timeline.
- Travel starts: based on the plan, user will be asked to either need map or
not.
If user needs map, map will appear and guide user to the
destination based on “where” information from current
location.
- After travel, it goes back to First Screen.

- After open, it goes back to First Screen.
VII. Click Setting button

- After setting, it goes back to First Screen.
Conclusion
If possible, making a landscape mode of the application as well.
The application will save information when it pauses, and travel plan will be
saved in the database.
It will take time to develop the application such as GPS real-time tracking, but I
believe plenty of sources could help hopefully.
I hope it helps the travelers more comfortable.
